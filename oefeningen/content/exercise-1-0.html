    <h2>For whom?</h2>
    <p>
        If you have just started playing the double bass, this exercise is a great way to familiarise yourself with your instrument. Even if you have been playing for a while, you may sometimes press the strings too hard or not hard enough. This exercise is therefore also intended to make you reflect on habits that you have developed over the years which may no longer be useful and may be preventing you from progressing. Consider, for example, playing fast. This becomes more difficult if you press the string too hard.
    </p>

    <h2>A small note regarding positions</h2>
    <p>
        There are many different views on how to name the positions on a double bass. For these exercises, positions are not particularly relevant, but I will sometimes refer to them when discussing the location on the bass. I will generally refer to the following areas (when viewed from the G string):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the lower part of the bass (G-D)</li>
        <li>the curve (until the thumb) D-G</li>
        <li>Lower thumb position: G-D (only an octave up).</li>
        <li>Upper thumb position: D–G.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I may say 'going up the bass'. Here, I am referring to the pitch. So, physically, you're going down, but the pitch will go up.

    <h2>1.0 Pressing the string with one finger <div class="finger-balls"><span class="finger-ball color-1"></span></div></h2>
    <h3>Preparatory exercise</h3>
    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <p>
        Choose a spot where you will press the string, somewhere halfway between the nut and the curve (where your thumb naturally falls going up the bass).
    </p>
    <p>
        To press the string, bend your finger so that it is not flat on the string. One helpful trick is to imagine that you are either holding a ball or drinking from a can of soda. Search online for examples (e.g. on YouTube) to see the shape of other bassists' hands. Ideally, your thumb should be opposite your middle finger when playing in the lower registers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your other hand should either rest on your bass or hang relaxed next to your body.
    </p>
    <h3>Execution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Place your index finger on the string, but do not press it down yet.</li>
        <li>Slowly press the string down until it touches the fretboard.</li>
        <li>Hold the string down against the fretboard for a moment.</li>
        <li>Slowly release the string from the fretboard, keeping your finger on the string.</li>
        <li>Do not look at your hand, but try to feel when the string is fully pressed down. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exercise with the app</h3>
    <p>Use exercise 1.0 from the learning path.</p>
    <p>
        When the ball gets smaller, press the string. When the ball is at its smallest, press the string all the way against the fretboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the ball starts to grow again, release the string slowly. The ball will grow until it reaches its maximum size. At this point, the string should be completely detached from the fretboard, with only the tips of your fingers touching the string.
    </p>
    <p>
        You should then see the ball move across the line and pulsate (get bigger and smaller). Now, repeat the movement while the ball rolls over the line.
    </p>

    <h3>Variation (extra)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Try the exercises on all the strings.</li>
        <li>Try different positions.</li>
        <li>Try lowering or raising your elbow and varying the angle of your hand.</li>
        <li>Do the exercise with the app using a stress ball.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Self-reflection (extra)</h3>
    <p>Do the preparation a few times and ask yourself the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How much pressure did I need to push the string against the fretboard?</li>
        <li>How did my thumb, hand, arm, shoulder, stomach, upper legs, lower legs and feet feel while I was doing this?</li>
        <li>Which direction were my hand and elbow pointing?</li>
        <li>Where on my bass can I now most easily press the string all the way down?</li>
        <li>What was the easiest position for my hands, arms, etc. to press the string all the way down?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Try to develop a reflex that enables you to feel which parts of your body are helping you to press the string. Note that the tension and muscles involved may change when you play while standing or sitting.

        1.2 Pressing the string with three fingers 
        <div class="finger-balls">
            <span class="finger-ball color-1"></span>
            <span class="finger-ball color-2"></span>
            <span class="finger-ball color-3"></span>
        </div>
    </h2>
    <p>
        A common system for pressing the string on a double bass is to use a maximum of three fingers in the low position: As well as the index and middle fingers, we use the ring finger. The ring finger is then supported by the little finger. In effect, you could say that the ring and little fingers together form one finger, meaning that you often play with three fingers in the lower positions.
    </p>
    <p>The following notation is usually used to indicate fingerings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1: the index finger</li>
        <li>2: the middle finger</li>
        <li>4: the ring finger and little finger.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In some cases, double bassists also use four fingers. This is possible in all positions if your hands are large enough, but it is usually done from the neck till thumb position (on the G string, this is from D to G). This option will not be used in this learning path, but it is possible.
    </p>

    <h3>Preparatory exercise</h3>
    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Again, choose a spot on the string to press, somewhere between the nut and the neck (where your thumb naturally falls when slides down your bass).</li>
        <li>As in previous exercises, imagine your fingers are curved and your thumb is positioned behind the neck.</li>
        <li>Your other hand should either rest on your bass or hang relaxed next to your body.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Execution</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Place all your fingers on the string at the same time, but do not press it yet.</li>
        <li>Now, press the string slowly until it touches the fretboard.</li>
        <li>Hold the string down for a moment while it is pressed against the fretboard.</li>
        <li>Slowly release the string from the fretboard while keeping your fingers on the string.</li>
        <li>Do not look at your hand, but try to feel when the string is fully pressed down.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exercise with the app</h3>
    <p>Use exercise 1.2 from the learning path (link to the exercise here).</p>
    <p>The colours now alternate, indicating when you need to change fingers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Index finger: <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" style="vertical-align: middle;"><circle cx="8" cy="8" r="7" fill="#f05442" stroke="#333" stroke-width="1"/></svg></li>
        <li>Middle finger: <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" style="vertical-align: middle;"><circle cx="8" cy="8" r="7" fill="#ffe064" stroke="#333" stroke-width="1"/></svg></li>
        <li>Ring and little finger: <svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" style="vertical-align: middle;"><circle cx="8" cy="8" r="7" fill="#0851bb" stroke="#333" stroke-width="1"/></svg></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Let your index finger help when pressing the string with your middle finger.</li>
        <li>Use your index and middle finger to help when pressing the string with your ring and little finger.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> Because the colours never come in the same order, you can never press the string at the 'right moment'. Pay attention to the pulse of the ball and try to switch when the ball is halfway through the pulse (the afterbeat/counterbeat). The idea is to follow the ball, so don't anticipate. See it as a game of imitation. You must first observe before you can imitate, and only then can you execute.
    </p>

    <h3>Variation (extra)</h3>
    <p>Variations from exercises 1.0 and 1.1:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Try the exercises on all strings.</li>
        <li>Try different positions.</li>
        <li>Lower or raise your elbow and vary the angle of your hand.</li>
        <li>Perform the exercise with a stress ball.</li>
        <li>When pressing with your middle finger, try releasing the string with your index finger.</li>
        <li>Press the string and vary the distance between your index and ring fingers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>New variations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the exercise, you should always press down with as many fingers as possible at the same time. Now try using your fingers separately.</li>
        <li>Press the string with only your little finger. Skip this exercise if it hurts too much.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Self-reflection (extra)</h3>
    <p>Do the preparation a few times, then answer the following questions for yourself:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Squeeze a stress ball or string and try to feel which muscles are involved in the action. Feel your hand, arm, and shoulder blades.</li>
        <li>Do the same exercise, but this time move your elbow to a different position. What can you feel?</li>
        <li>What happened when you pressed the string with your little finger? Was this easy or difficult? Note: there are no wrong answers. These questions are designed to help you identify what you are physically capable of right now.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Keep practising until you develop a reflex for feeling which parts of your body help you press the string.</p>
