            <p>
            Select a starting point and begin. This can be anywhere on one string. When the ball goes down, adjust the pitch downwards. When the ball goes up, adjust the pitch upwards. 
            When the ball is on a plateau, such as a flat line, leave the pitch as it is.
            </p>

                Use the controls to adjust the speed, the number of slopes and other settings.

                Use the colour pickers to select a colour for each finger. These colours indicate when you need to switch fingers. Use the colour tempo slider to adjust the speed of the colour changes. It is best to start with chromatic pitches (e.g. A–B♭–B), but you can also choose a different pitch sequence. Practise on a flat line first and then adjust the slopes.

                You can also choose to follow a learning path. In this case, the settings will be adjusted automatically for you. When you are ready, simply click on the next level.
