            <h2>A brief explanation:</h2>
            <p>
                Navigate through dynamically generated landscapes. Pay attention to the <strong>pitch</strong> and
                <strong>speed</strong>! Bass Ball is an open-ended game and a fun way to practise the movements needed
                to improve your left-hand and arm technique. Visual cues guide you through the movements as you
                practise, and the ever-changing settings ensure that each game is different.

            <h2>How to play</h2>
            <p>
                Instead of notes, Bass Ball provides a visual cue in the form of a ball that you must follow through a
                landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
                Select a starting point and begin. This can be anywhere on a single string. When the ball moves
                downwards, adjust the pitch accordingly. When the ball moves upwards, adjust the pitch upwards. When the
                ball reaches a plateau, leave the pitch as it is. It's similar to real musical notation, where you also
                have to intonate upwards when the notes are written higher on the stave. This way, you always follow the
                same logic. Do you find it difficult to make sound (using your bow or pizzicato) while moving your left hand? If so,
                disconnect it for a moment and practise the movement with your left hand first, adding the sound later.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the controls to adjust the speed, number of slopes, and other settings.</li>
                <li>Use the colour selectors to assign a colour to each finger. These colours indicate when you need to
                    change fingers. Use the colour tempo slider to adjust the speed of the colour changes. It is best to
                    start with chromatic pitches (e.g. A–B♭–B), but you can also choose a different sequence of pitches.
                    Practise on a flat line first, then adjust the slopes.</li>
                <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Because the colours never come in the same order, it is impossible to press
                    the string at the 'right moment'. Pay attention to the pulse of the ball and try to switch when the
                    ball is halfway through the pulse (the afterbeat/counterbeat). The idea is to follow the ball, so
                    don't anticipate. Think of it as a game where you have to imitate someone else. Before you can
                    imitate, you must first observe, and only then can you perform.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You can also choose to follow a learning path. In that case, the settings will be adjusted
                automatically. When you are ready, simply click on the next level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you have someone to do this with? Be sure to give it a try! It doesn't have to be a double bass
                player – a violinist, guitarist or wind player could play this game with you too.

            <h4>In summary:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Getting started:</strong> Follow the moving ball on the screen.</li>
                <li><strong>Ball up:</strong> Play a higher pitch.</li>
                <li><strong>Ball down:</strong> Play a lower pitch.</li>
                <li><strong>Plateau:</strong> Keep the pitch the same.</li>
                <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Follow the ball and don't anticipate. Move your left hand first and add the
                    sound later.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjust settings:</strong> Adjust the speed, number of slopes, and other settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Colours for fingers:</strong> Select colours for your fingers to practise changing fingers.

            <h2>How do I integrate this into my practice routine?</h2>
            <p>
                Baseball is ideal for doing at the beginning of a practice session as a warm-up activity. If you follow
                a learning path, the difficulty level will adjust automatically. This enables you to build your skills
                gradually. Exercises do not have to take long; you can decide how to structure them. If you have
                difficulty with open-ended goals, I recommend using a timer. Set a timer for 5–10 minutes, then move on
                to the rest of your learning material. If this is too long, set a timer for between two and five
                minutes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The open goals/endings are deliberate. Learning is a lifelong process, after all, and we're just playing
                a game here. I would like to challenge you to stop thinking in terms of right or wrong and focus instead
                on paying attention to the movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you follow a learning path, there is always an explanation of how to complete the exercise.
                Learning paths also include questions for self-reflection during or after a session.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are already working on a piece, try choosing a difficult passage. Look at the highest and lowest
                notes and the metronome tempo. Try applying this to the game.
            </p>

            <h4>In summary:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Warm-up:</strong> Use Bass ball at the start of your practice session.</li>
                <li><strong>Time limit:</strong> Practice for 2–10 minutes to maintain focus.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on the movement:</strong> Focus on the movement itself, not on whether it is right or
                    wrong.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-reflection:</strong> Use the questions in the learning pathways to evaluate your
                    movements.</li>
                <li><strong>Specific passages:</strong> Apply the Bass Ball technique to difficult passages in your
                    music.</li>

            <h2>Do I really need a moving ball for this?</h2>
            <p>
                No, you don't need to use a moving ball on a screen. However, you are more likely to stick with it if
                you are guided through the process. This makes the element of movement more conscious in your double
                bass studies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The exercises can be very challenging at high settings and require a lot of attention. By disconnecting
                the movements from your usual way of working, I hope you will pay more attention to them. Ultimately,
                playing an instrument is, technically speaking, nothing more than a series of highly refined and
                coordinated movements performed at a certain speed. Additionally, there is a good chance that while you
                study you pieces you're limiting yourself to those positions alone, which I certainly don't dispute as a
                learning method. However, as a result, you remain in your (ultimately) comfortable positions for a long
                time. And, as a bassist, you will have to move around the bass a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
                These exercises should give you a better idea of what it feels like to navigate the bass, and help
                prepare you for your daily studies and performances.

            <h2>For teachers:</h2>
            <p>
                There is a growing focus on physical awareness when learning to play an instrument. For the double bass
                in particular, this is a positive development because the instrument is prone to injury due to its
                challenging playability. These exercises can be categorised as movement-oriented learning. First, we
                observe the movement, and then we try to apply it to playing an instrument. As a teacher, you play a
                central role, but you should also encourage your students to become more independent learners. Playing
                an instrument requires physical intelligence, and these exercises are designed to stimulate this,
                setting students on the path to independently sensing what needs to be done.
            </p>
            <p>
                These exercises can be used in class or as homework. Beginners who cannot yet read music can quickly get
                started this way. If you are teaching several students at the same time, they can do this exercise
                either individually or together.
            </p>
            <p>
                By following the learning paths, you can gradually help students to become more aware of their
                movements. This can be done in class or assigned as homework. Additionally, you can use the exercises to
                differentiate between students of different levels.
            </p>
            <p>
                By isolating the movements, it is possible to provide specific feedback. The questions in the learning
                paths also offer a starting point for reflection.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following didactic principles are incorporated into this application and the design of the learning
                paths: gradualness, limitation, self-direction, self-reflection, collaboration, abstraction, random
                practice, differentiation and individualisation, and integration.
            </p>

            <h4>To conclude</h4>
            <p>
                As teachers, we are always looking for new ways to teach, and ways to help our students become better
                musicians. Even a small exercise can require a lot of planning in advance, and it's impossible to
                predict how students will respond or develop. However, above all, hopefully this provides you with
                something small and fun to add to your lessons.
